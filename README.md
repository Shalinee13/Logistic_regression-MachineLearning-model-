# Logistic_regression-MachineLearning-model-
Welcome to the Logistic Regression Repository! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of resources and code examples for logistic regression, a powerful statistical technique used for modeling and predicting categorical outcomes.
Whether you are new to logistic regression or an experienced data scientist, this repository is designed to support your learning, implementation, and exploration of logistic regression methods.

# Introduction to Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a widely used statistical technique for modeling the relationship between independent variables and a binary or categorical dependent variable. It is particularly useful when you want to understand the probability of an event or predict class membership based on a set of explanatory variables. 

### Tutorials
